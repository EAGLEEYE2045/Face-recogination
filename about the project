This project is a Facial Recognition-based Automatic Door Lock and Attendance System designed to enhance security and streamline attendance tracking.
The system utilizes advanced facial recognition algorithms to authenticate individuals and automatically unlock the door upon successful identification. 
It replaces traditional methods such as key cards or passwords, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
In addition to door security, the system automatically logs the attendance of recognized individuals, making it ideal for use in institutions, workplaces, or secure facilities.
Built using [OpenCV, Python], the project demonstrates a practical application of AI in real-world scenarios.
